# ToDoList-Morgane2t-CODF3
A to-do list to keep track of things to do!

Right now, the project works as follows:
It displays a list of actions (add task, complete task, delete task, view tasks or exit) and the user chooses by inputing a number. 
When an action is done, it displays again the list of actions until the user press the key to exit.

I advise to run the project on visual studio code. 
The code is really simple so maybe it could benefit from the addition of new features such as seeing the done actions in a separate category than the things to do or adding the date when an action is done ?
