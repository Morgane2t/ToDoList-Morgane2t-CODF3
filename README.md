# ToDoList-Morgane2t-CODF3
A to-do list to keep track of things to do!

##Getting started
These are the instructions to get the project on your machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/Morgane2t/ToDoList-Morgane2t-CODF3.git

```
Then get the code in the file [todo-code.py](https://github.com/Morgane2t/ToDoList-Morgane2t-CODF3/blob/4a7b2c506c2a2b2723f9378fd0f88253f9040f79/todo_code.py) on a python IDE such as visual studio code and you can now change it as you wish.

## The project
Right now, the project works as follows:
It displays a list of actions (add task, complete task, delete task, view tasks or exit) and the user chooses by inputing a number. 
When an action is done, it displays again the list of actions until the user press the key to exit.

## Contributions 
The code is really simple so maybe it could benefit from the addition of new features such as seeing the done actions in a separate category than the things to do or adding the date when an action is done ?
